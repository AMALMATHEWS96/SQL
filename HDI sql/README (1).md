The Human Development Index (HDI) is a statistical measure used to assess and compare the development levels of different countries or regions. It was developed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) as a way to go beyond purely economic indicators, such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and provide a more comprehensive picture of human well-being and progress.

#Components of the HDI:

Life expectancy at birth: This indicator measures the average number of years a person is expected to live from birth. It reflects the overall health and healthcare access in a country.

Education: The education component of the HDI includes two sub-indicators:
a. Mean years of schooling: It represents the average number of years of education received by people aged 25 and above.
b. Expected years of schooling: This indicator measures the number of years of schooling a child of school entrance age can expect to receive in the future.

Gross National Income (GNI) per capita: GNI per capita is a measure of the average income of residents in a country. It takes into account the total income generated within a country as well as income from abroad (remittances, investments, etc.) and adjusts it based on the population size.
